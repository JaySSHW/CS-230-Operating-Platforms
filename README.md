# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

### Client Summary
The client, The Gaming Room, wanted to expand their Android game Draw It or Lose It into a web-based, cross-platform application. The system needed to support multiple teams and players, enforce unique game and team names, and maintain a single instance of the game service while still generating unique IDs for games, teams, and players. The goal was to create a scalable design that could support many concurrent users and work across desktop and mobile browsers.
### What I Did Well
I believe I did well organizing the design document in a clear, professional format. I explained the requirements, design constraints, domain model, and platform evaluation in a way that both technical and non-technical readers could understand. My evaluation of Linux, macOS, Windows, and mobile platforms showed thoughtful analysis about scalability, cost, and system performance.
### How the Design Helped My Coding
Working through the design document before coding helped me understand how the classes and system components should interact. Planning the Entity hierarchy and GameService Singleton early made it easier to visualize how the application would manage games, teams, and players consistently.
### Understanding User Needs
I interpreted user needs by focusing on gameplay fairness, accessibility, and cross-platform support. Players need an easy way to create games, join teams, and play smoothly without naming conflicts or system errors. Considering user needs is essential because software only succeeds if it provides a reliable and enjoyable experience.
### My Design Approach
I approached the design using requirement analysis, UML-style domain modeling, and evaluation of operating platforms. In future projects, I would also include early prototyping and user-feedback testing to strengthen the design process.
